                    Meteor has been around since 2011. It is a full-stack JavaScript framework for web and mobile applications. It
                    comes with a built-in instance of mongodb. Upon starting a meteor application, the database is automatically
                    created and may be bootstrapped with initial data. This provides an immediate head-start to beginning development.
                    Meteor makes it easy to build robust, secure real-time web applications, handling everything from the browser
                    app to the server or database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It makes developing web applications simple. It is easy to learn, and it lets you focus more on the functionality
                    of your application than the basics of syncing data and serving pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also has lots of behaviors conveniently built in. Meteor automatically performs live updates, so data changes
                    show up immediately in your browser window, and even code changes to the application itself are pushed to
                    all browsers and devices in “real-time”. Meteor has built-in latency compensation, is easy to deploy, and
                    has easy-to-install “packages” that handle all sorts of functionality.

                <p>
                    Once installed, create your first application:
                    <br>In your cmd/terminal, navigate to where you want to store your app and typing the following command: “meteor
                    create ContactBook”. This creates a new folder named, “ContactBook” and populates it with some boilerplate and dependent code.
                </p>
                <img src="img/createProject.png">
                <p>
                    To run the application, In the console, move into the folder. Then type “meteor” in the console to begin running
                    it and see how it looks. Once meteor is running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
                    to see it in action. Note, any change you make to the files in the folder will cause meteor to instantly
                    recompile and reload the page. This is part of the instant deployment during development.
                </p>

            <div class="container-100">
                <h3>2. Setting up Database</h3>
                <p>
                    Inside the ContactBook folder, create a new folder named “collections”. In the collections folder, create a file
                    named persons.js (by typing: cd > persons.js). For the contents of this file, include the following (you
                    can use any text editor to edit file's content):
                </p>
                <p style="background: azure">
                    <br> Persons = new Mongo.Collection('person');
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above code tells Meteor to create a collection named “person". Now we need to populate the data. In the base
                    ContactBook folder, go to the folder named “server”. Inside the “server” folder, create a new file named
                    “data.js”. Add the following to the data.js file:
                </p>
                <img src="img/datajs.png">
                <p>
                    Save the file and meteor will rebuild the application. Now, in the web browser console, try typing in the find
                    statement, to list all database records for the Persons collection.
                </p>
                <p style="background: azure">
                    <br> Persons.find().fetch()
                    <br>

            <div class="container-100">
                <h3>3. Create Master Page Layout and View</h3>
                <p>
                    We’ll start by adding a master layout, which will serve the individual single page web application view templates.
                    <br> First, in the root “ContactBook” folder, create a folder named “client” (if you don't have one). Inside
                    the client folder, delete main.html, main.css, main.js that have already been there and create a file named
                    “app.head.html”, with the following contents:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <img src="img/header.png">
                <p>
                    Next, Inside the “client” folder, create another folder named “views”. Inside this folder, create a folder named
                    “layout”. In the layout folder, create a file named “layout.html”. Enter the following for its contents:
                </p>
                <img src="img/body.png">
                <p>
                    The “yield” keyword is where the content from our partial views will be rendered. This is the key behind the
                    single page navigation of meteor web applications. Now Let’s create our home view. Inside the “views” folder,
                    create a file named “home.html”. For the contents of this file, include the following:
                </p>
                <img src="img/home.png">
                <p>In the “views” folder, create another file named “about.html”, with the following contents:</p>
                <img src="img/about.png">
                <p>
                    Inside the “views” folder, create another folder named “controls”. We’ll now create the sub-control to render
                    our form. In the “controls” folder, create a file named “contactForm.html”, this is a simple form for adding
                    a new person to the database. Adding into the file with the following contents:
                </p>
                <img src="img/contactForm.png">
            </div>
            <div class="container-100">
                <h3>4. Setting up Routing</h3>
                <p>
                    In the root “ContactBook” folder, create a file named “client.js”. For the contents, include the following:
                </p>
                <img src="img/routing.png">
                <p>
                    Next, in the console, hit CTRL-C twice to quit the meteor.exe process. Then type: “meteor add iron:router”. This
                    will add the routing package to the application. Finally, type “meteor” to launch the web application again.
                    Refresh your web browser and you should see the web page displayed.
                </p>
                <img src="img/body.png">
            </div>
            <div class="container-100">
                <h3>5. Displaying Data</h3>
                <p>
                    Let’s show the list of people on our home page, just above the form. To do this, we’ll need to create another
                    partial view control. Inside the folder “ContactBook/client/views/controls” create a file named “persons.html”.
                    Add the following contents to the file:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <img src="img/person.png">
                <p>
                    Let’s include this new view in our home page. Edit the file “ContactBook/client/views/home.html” so it renders
                    the new control, as follows:
                </p>
                <img src="img/home2.png">
                <p>
                    Finally, we need to give the template access to the data for Persons. We can do this with a simple helper method.
                    Edit the file “ContactBook/client.js” to contain the following:
                </p>
                <img src="img/client2.png">
                <p>
                    Now get back to your browser to see the result. Meteor should have automatically refreshed your web page at this
                    point.
                </p>
                <img src="img/page.png">

            <div class="container-100">
                <h3>6. Adding an Event Handler for Clicking a Button and create Inserting method</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a new file in the root “ContactBook” folder, named “events.js”, with the following contents:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <img src="img/events.png">

                <p>
                    At the console, hit CTRL-C twice to exit the meteor.exe process. Type: “meteor add accounts-password” then type
                    “meteor add accounts-ui”. Edit the file “/ContactBook/client/views/layout/layout.html” and modify the html
                    as follows:
                    <br>

                <p>
                    Our data is still open to anonymous users. Let’s now restrict it only to logged-in users. Edit the file “ContactBook/methods.js”,
                    as follows:
                </p>
                <img src="img/method2.png">
                <p>
                    Anonymous users will see people created by no particular user, while logged-in users will see both their own
                    records, and anonymous records. Edit the file “ContactBook/server/data.js” and change the Meteor.publish(…)
                    code to include a query, as follows:
                </p>
                <img src="img/datajs2.png">
                <p>
                    Make one final change to “Contact/client/views/controls/persons.html” so that we can show the records created

                    As there are many competing web frameworks for creating applications, it’s helpful to master at least one or
                    two. However, learning new frameworks is an excellent way to stay up-to-date. In this regard, let’s consider
                    the pros and cons of a web application based upon Meteor.
